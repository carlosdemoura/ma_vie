`ma_vie` is my implementation of Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using Python-Tkinter. I started the development in the summer of 2024 - for fun. Now, 1 yr later, I decided to upload it (with some adjustments). Checking my files, it's clear there was um attempt to rewrite the app in object oriented. Unfortunately, it didin't work and I had other priorities at the time. Fortunately I've saved the working version. Maybe I try to do these adjustements.

All game was implemented in Portuguese. To play it, you must download the repo - if necessary, activate the venv - and run the `main.py` file.

Beware! `TKinter` buttons represent dots, and `ma_vie` dots have life.
